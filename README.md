# Academic Research Project Page Template

A clean, responsive template for academic research project pages.

This template is a modified version of [eliahuhorwitz/Academic-project-page-template](https://github.com/eliahuhorwitz/Academic-project-page-template).

Example project pages built using this template are:

- WIP
- WIP
- WIP

## Start using the template

### Create a repository using template

To start using the template click on "Use this Template" > "Create a new repository".
<img width="800" height="1713" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90fb70fc-3997-472a-8028-d09f634142ec" />

Select owner, put repository name, and write description.
You can keep the repository private, but you have to make it public to publish GitHub Pages if the owner is organization (or change GitHub plan). You can change visibility after you complete editing the file.

### Edit files

The template uses html for controlling the content and css for controlling the style.
To edit the websites contents edit the `index.html` file. It contains different HTML "building blocks", use whichever ones you need and comment out the rest.

Search "TODO" in `index.html` for editable parts.

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to replace the `favicon.ico` under `static/images/` with one of your own, otherwise your favicon is going to be a dreambooth image of me.

### Development Setup

When you open the project in VS Code, you'll be prompted to install the recommended extensions (or search @recommended in the Extensions view). Once installed, the code will automatically format on save, keeping your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code clean and consistent.

### Publish page using GitHub Pages

Go "Settings" > "Pages"

<img width="800" height="2088" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81a15c17-ec4b-436a-befb-3256beaa06c4" />

On branch selection, select "main" and save.

<img width="400" height="2063" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe10562f-2d55-4a0d-8f6f-d7e92d65a1b2" />

Wait a while, and you'll see the link of the published page.

<img width="800" height="1989" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f06c2238-1c0f-4ea2-ba5e-b9c658384eb4" />

Also, don't forget to show the published link in the repo description. Select "Use your GitHub Pages website" to put the GitHub Pages link automatically.
